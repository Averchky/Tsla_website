                <p>Tesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California. Tesla's current products include electric cars,
                battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, as well as other related products and services. In 2020,
                Tesla had the highest sales in the plug-in and battery electric passenger car segments, capturing 16% of the plug-in market (which includes plug-in hybrids) and
                23% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market. Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of solar photovoltaic energy generation systems
                in the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 3 GWh of battery storage supplied in 2020.</p>
                <p>Tesla was founded (as Tesla Motors) on July 1, 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in San Carlos, California.
                The founders were influenced to start the company after General Motors recalled all its EV1 electric cars in 2003 and then destroyed them, and seeing the higher fuel efficiency of
                battery-electric cars as an opportunity to break the usual correlation between high performance and low fuel economy in automobiles. The AC Propulsion tzero also inspired the company's
                first vehicle, the Roadster. Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer software,
                and the proprietary motor". Before the company was founded the creator of the TZero introduced the founders, including Elon Musk, who eventually contributed US$6.5 million of the initial
                (Series A) US$7.5 million round of investment in February 2004 and became chairman of the board of directors. Musk then appointed Eberhard as the CEO. J.B. Straubel joined in May 2004
                as the fifth founder. Eberhard was removed by the board after a whistleblower reported him for reporting fraudulent financial numbers to the board. Eberhard then filed a lawsuit claiming libel.
                The lawsuit backfired and Eberhard was forced to admit all five original members (Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk and Straubel) were co-founders, and barred Eberhard from further attacking the
                other founders with false accusations, or making any disparaging remarks about Tesla itself. Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level,
                but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. Eberhard acknowledged that Musk was the person who insisted from the beginning on a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer body and
                that Musk led design of components ranging from the power electronics module to the headlamps and other styling. Musk received the Global Green 2006 product design award for his design of the Tesla Roadster,
                presented by Mikhail Gorbachev, and he also received the 2007 Index Design award for his design of the Tesla Roadster.</p>
